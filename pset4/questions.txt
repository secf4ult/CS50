0.  GIF: 256 colors, PNG: 16 million, JPEG: 16 million, BMP: depends on how many bits per pixel.
1.  GIF.
2.  The data with lossless compression is exact the same as the original when it's uncompressed, while the lossy compression is not completely recoverable.
3.  JPEG, BMP, PNG.
4.  First, the system chagnes the filename’s first character in the file’s directory entry. Second, the system moves all of the file’s FAT clusters to the hard drive’s list of free clusters. 
5.  Overwriting user data with one or two passes of random data or use sanitization tools.
6.  A library declares a set of integer types.
7.  It makes clear that we know exactly the data type and the length.
8.  BYTE: 1 byte, DWORD: 4 byte,LONG: 4 byte, WORD: 2 byte.
9.  BM
10. bfSize specifies the size of the bitmap file. biSize specifies the size of the structure in bytes.
11. the bitmap is top-down.
12. biBitCount .
13. Can't creat a new file.
14. Because we already set the size we read to the size of BITMAPFILEHEADER and BITMAPINFOHEADER, so we only need to read it once.
15. 3
16. fseek can set sthe file position indicator.
17. The cursor that we currently read on.
18. Looks like Rick Astley to me.
